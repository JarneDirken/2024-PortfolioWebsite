Each team focused on specific aspectsâ€”AI on the model, CCS on AWS setup, and application students on frontend development. <br><br>As the team lead, I facilitated collaboration, particularly between CCS and AI, ensuring the project's smooth progress. By week 3, we successfully integrated components, overcoming challenges in AWS implementation.
